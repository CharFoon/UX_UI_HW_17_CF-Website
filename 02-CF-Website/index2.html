        <p>Hi!</p><br>
        <p>I’m Charmaine.</p><br>
        <p>A UX/UI Designer</p><br>
        <p>from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>
        <p>I want to help raise a child. 
            “Excuse me?” you say. Stay with me here... 
            Remember that proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child?” Now if that village was a forward-thinking design team, made up of product managers, UX/UI designers, developers and stakeholders… and that child was a user-centred product, created to solve problems and enhance the end-user experience, then, yes! I’d like to be part of that proverbial village raising that child.”
            You say, “It takes commitment.” 
            I say, “I’m in – hook, line and sinker!”
            Optimistic. Empathetic. Passionate. Collaborative. Flexible. 5 words used to describe me. Not just in a professional capacity, but in a personal one too. Why am I telling you this? Because I believe that many of the values we hold as a person, carry over into our work too.
            Design is first and foremost my interest and passion. Design in aesthetics and thinking. That’s why no matter which avenue I explore in life, it always brings me back to this. UX/UI Design has allowed me to embrace my creativity in a collaborative and meaningful way. </p>
